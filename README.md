# Ca_spike_detection
 convert each time series into an event train, in which an (instantaneous) event corresponds to the beginning of a detected calcium transient. For three selected cells, plot the continuous fluorescence time series as a function of time, with the times of detected events marked by a tick overlaid on the same plot.
